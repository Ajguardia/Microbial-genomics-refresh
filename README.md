# Microbial-genomics-refresh
Applied bioinformatics project: genomic and phylogenetic analysis of clinically relevant bacteria and viruses

# Microbial Genomics & Pathogen Detection – Bioinformatics Refresh

## Background
This repository contains a personal bioinformatics refresh project focused on the genomic analysis of clinically relevant bacteria and viruses.  
The objective is to strengthen applied skills in sequence analysis, phylogeny, and pathogen detection pipelines, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility and best practices commonly used in academic research environments.

This work is motivated by prior laboratory experience in:
- Multiplex RT-PCR optimisation for viral pathogen detection
- Microbial genomics and biofilm-associated bacteria
- Environmental and clinical microbiology

## Objectives
- Refresh and consolidate skills in microbial and viral genomics
- Perform sequence quality control, alignment, and phylogenetic analysis
- Apply bioinformatics tools commonly used in pathogen detection
- Develop reproducible and well-documented analysis pipelines
- Build a public portfolio suitable for academic and PhD applications

## Scope
The project will focus on:
- Clinically relevant bacteria (e.g. *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*)
- Clinically relevant viruses (e.g. influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2)
- Publicly available datasets from NCBI and related databases

## Tools and Technologies
- Operating system: Linux
- Scripting: Bash
- Programming: R
- Bioinformatics tools:
  - BLAST
  - MAFFT
  - IQ-TREE / FastTree
  - Galaxy (when appropriate)
- Version control: Git & GitHub
